RegEx.py takes in a file of postfix expressions in a language Σ=(a,b,c,d,e),
E represents ε and 0 represents the null set, and outputs a table representative
of the associated nfa.

Example of table output
Input ab+
Output
|q  |    a|    b|    c|    d|    e|      E|
|---|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|
|0  |   1 |     |     |     |     |       |
|1  |     |     |     |     |     |   5   |
|2  |     |   3 |     |     |     |       |
|3  |     |     |     |     |     |   5   |
|4 S|     |     |     |     |     | 2 , 0 |
|5 F|     |     |     |     |     |       |

Start state is labeled with an 'S' and final state is labeled 'F', first column 'q'
is a column for the different states, the numbers in the other columns represent
the state change after the corresponding trigger.

Have file of postfix expressions each on a different line in a plain text file.
Place the plain text file in the same directory as the python files included.
Execute RegEx.py with python launcher and follow the directions that appear on
screen, which should be to enter the file name.

RegEx.py: Main class that makes an nfa and table
Stack.py: Essentially turns append() into push() for aesthetic purposes.
Node.py: Data structure that builds the nfa.
